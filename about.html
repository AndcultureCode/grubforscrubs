                campaign. If you can’t find an answer to your question, feel free to <a class="typeform-share"

            <h2>Question & Answer</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>What happens when I donate to a restaurant or coffee shop?</h3>
                    <p>Your donation amount will be added to the restaurant or coffee shop’s total. When that business
                        hits a milestone, including covering the cost for processing fees, the Grub for Scrubs
                        fundraising coordinator will reach out to place an order for delivery. The target milestone
                        amount is based on what the business will be delivering. It is $1,000 for meal delivery and $250
                        for a coffee or baked goods delivery. The delivery date will be scheduled in coordination with
                        UPMC Pinnacle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What happens when I donate to the general donation fund?</h3>
                    <p>While we monitor donation activity to determine how we best support those working towards a goal,
                        we want to use the general donation funds as quickly as we can to place orders for delivery. The
                        process is as follows: Your general donation amount will be added to the general donation total.
                        When the general donation total hits a milestone, including covering the cost for processing
                        fees, the Grub for Scrubs fundraising coordinator will reach out to the next business in the
                        order queue to place an order for delivery. The order queue is managed by the Grub for Scrubs
                        fundraising coordinator, and businesses are added to the order queue based on their onboarding
                        date. The target milestone amount is based on what the business will be delivering. It is $1,000
                        for meal delivery and $250 for a coffee or baked goods delivery. The delivery date will be
                        scheduled in coordination with UMPC Pinnacle.</p>
                    <p>If donations to the campaign slow or if a business is unable to hit a milestone, the general
                        donation fund could be used to help a restaurant or coffee shop hit the target goal to trigger
                        an order. The Grub for Scrubs fundraising coordinators are monitoring the donations to determine
                        if funds should be allocated from the general donation fund to restaurants or coffee shops to
                        help them reach a milestone. The goal is to place orders as quickly and as frequently as we can
                        to make an impact on all involved.</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>What happens if a restaurant does not hit the target milestone?</h3>
                    <p>The Grub for Scrubs fundraising coordinators are monitoring the donations to determine if funds
                        should be allocated from the general donation fund to restaurants or coffee shops to help them
                        reach a milestone. The goal is to place orders as quickly and as frequently as we can to make an
                        impact on all involved. If you are a donor or business that is interested in helping a
                        restaurant or coffee shop hit a milestone and you need help through the process, please feel
                        free to use <a class="typeform-share" href="https://webusersurvey.typeform.com/to/wEhwkV"

                    <p>The goal is to run the Grub for Scrubs fundraiser for as long as we can. We will continue to use
                        the donations to purchase meals at local restaurants to feed healthcare providers at UPMC
                        Pinnacle until all of the donation funds have been used.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Where can I find the total amount raised for the campaign?</h3>
                    <p>The total amount raised can be found at the top of the website homepage. The total amount
                        includes all donations made to both the general fund and to restaurants or coffee shops. It does
                        not factor in the cost of processing fees.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>How many meals are delivered per order?</h3>
                    <p>Our goal is to deliver enough food, coffee or bakery items for 100 people at UPMC Pinnacle per
                        delivery. The Grub for Scrubs fundraising coordinators are monitoring donation activity and will
                        adjust as needed to ensure we can place orders as quickly and as frequently as we can to make an
                        impact on all involved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Who is delivering the meals?</h3>
                    <p>Each restaurant or coffee shop is helping to provide delivery.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What type of meals will be provided?</h3>
                    <p>The goal is to provide something that is “grab and go” style — such as sandwiches, wraps, coffee,
                        baked goods, etc. The Grub for Scrubs fundraising coordinator is working closely with UPMC
                        Pinnacle to stagger delivery dates and times.</p>
